          There are some rules that you have to follow if you want to write a good code in html.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Unless you want to write good code, then you probably should stick to some form of standards.
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Rule of tages:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tags are always surrounded by angle brackets (less-than/greater-than characters).
          </li>
          <li>
            If it is possible make sure that the name of the tages are lower case.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most tags come in pairs and surround the material they affect, they work like a light switch: the first tag turns the action on, and the second turns it off
          </li>
          <li>
            The second tag--the "off switch"--always starts with a forward slash.
          </li>
          <li>
            First tag on, last tag off, tags are embedded, so when you start a tag within another tag, you have to close that inner tag before closing the outer tag
          </li>
          <li>
            Many tags have optional attributes that use values to modify the tag's behavior.
          </li>
        </ul>

          The rules of the way that you write your code:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Write readable yet efficient code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave typography to the CSS.
          </li>
          <li>
            If avoidable, do not hard-code! (The only things that should be hard-coded are constants. Thatâ€™s it)
          </li>
          <li>
            Write test cases (this will help you a lot)
          </li>
          <li>
            Write comments and documentation (commiting your code and providing proper documentation)
          </li>
          <li>
            Save and back up your code on some kind of version controle system is a simple way to ensure that your code stays safe.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep your code portable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Split your code into short.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be consistent!
          </li>
          <li>
            Validate your code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that you write a proper indentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that you set the caracter properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Respect syntax and sematics.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Define a doctype at the top.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can not have an end tag without a start tag.
              </li>
              <li>
                Every start tag needs:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Start with a infiriority symbole 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    End with a greater symbole
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Every end tag needs
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Start with a infiriority symbole with /
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ends with a greater symbole.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                You should use lower case for element name.
              </li>
              <li>
                Should indent child element.
              </li>
              <li>
                Nest element properly.
              </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
